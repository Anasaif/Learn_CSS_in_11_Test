        Arthur Schopenhauer searches for songs in the key of life. It has always
        been said that music is the language of feeling and of passion, as words
        are the language of reason.

        In the course of history, music is the greatest creation of mankind.
        Creativity in the pure and undiluted form is the true definition of
        Music. Music is an important part of our life as it is a way of
        expressing our feelings as well as emotions. Some people consider music
        as a way to escape from the pain of life.

        Studies have shown that music can buoy your mood and fend off
        depression. It can also improve blood flow in ways similar to statins,
        lower your levels of stress-related hormones like cortisol and ease
        pain. Listening to music before an operation can even improve
        post-surgery outcomes.
