          <h2>Baby elephants are super close to their mothers</h2>
          <p>
            Baby elephants stay very close to their mothers for the first couple
            of months. The calves drink their mother’s milk for about two years,
            sometimes longer. They drink up to three gallons of milk a day! At
            about four months old, they also begin eating some plants, like
            adult elephants, but they continue to need as much milk from their
            mother. We think it’s one of the adorable things how attached they
            are to their mothers, who immediately know if their young are in any
            distress.

          <h2>They suck their trunks like a human baby sucks their thumbs</h2>
          <p>
            At first, baby elephants don’t really know what to do with their
            trunks. They swing them to and fro and sometimes even step on them.
            They will suck their trunk just as a human baby might suck its
            thumb!
          </p>
          <p>
            By about 6 to 8 months, calves begin learning to use their trunks to
            eat and drink. By the time they are a year old, they can control
            their trunks pretty well and, like adult elephants, use their trunks
            for grasping, eating, drinking, bathing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Baby elephants are cute, there are no two ways about that. But, they
            are also highly evolved and one of the most advanced species when it
            comes to their newborn capabilities. Female elephants have the
            longest gestation period of all mammals, lasting as long as 23
            months! After spending so long being nurtured by their mummies
            bellies, it’s no surprise that baby elephants are pretty smart
            little babies when they are finally welcomed to the world.

            Luckily, the female elephant community is social and supportive,
            with young calves being tended to not only by their mothers but also
            by other females in the herd. When a new baby is born, all of the
            females in the group trumpet the news and announce the new arrival.
            Within minutes of being born, the calf must stand on its own four
            feet, literally. Much more so than other animals, elephant babies
            exclusively learn how to adapt to their new surroundings by
            following the behavior of their mothers over a long period of time.

          <h2>Question:</h2>
          <p>
            <b>1. </b> What did we do to deserve baby elephants and all the
            cuteness they bestow on the world? Make sure you spend National
            Elephant Appreciation Day learning all about the animals and raising
            awareness to ensure their survival.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>2. </b> The United States implemented a near-total ban on
            elephant ivory trade in 2016, and the United Kingdom, Singapore,
            Hong Kong, and other elephant ivory markets followed suit. Most
            significantly, China took the remarkable step of closing its legal
            domestic ivory market at the end of 2017.

            Alert: Poaching threatens many species and can contribute to
            extinction. It can also have a tremendous impact on the environment,
            especially when a keystone species such as the elephant is targeted.
            A keystone species is an animal that plays a critical role in its
            ecological community.
